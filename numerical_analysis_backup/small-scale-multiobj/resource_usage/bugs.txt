arch2_decomposition_new.py
1. check the numeric types of traffic_capacities, tm, change them all to float.
	Use int only when it is index
2. traffic_capacities is wrong for self.tm < self.slot_capacity, guardband is 
	not included
3. efficiency is also wrong, since traffic_capacities is wrong, but closer to
	the correct answer
4. tensor is wrong since the number of occupied slots does not match the that 
	given by the connection list

arch5_decomposition_new.py
1. either the MILP or the tensor is wrong
